# Introduction


This demo project showcases face detection on a Renesas RA8 microcontroller using the RUHMI Framework. A camera captures images, and a lightweight neural network detects faces in real time. Results are displayed on an LCD with bounding boxes. The project demonstrates efficient AI inference and processing on embedded systems
