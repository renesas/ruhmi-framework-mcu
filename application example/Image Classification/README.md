# Introduction


This demo showcases an image classification application using MobileNet_v1 on the Renesas RA8P1 MCU with Arm Ethos-U55 support. It leverages the RUHMI Framework for efficient model deployment. Real-time inference is performed on camera input, and the top-5 classification results are displayed on an LCD, demonstrating low-power, high-performance edge AI capabilities.
